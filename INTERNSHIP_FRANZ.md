# **Internship**

As a student, having a good internship is a valuable stepping stone for the real world. It helps the individual experience the real world application of everything they learn in school. Landing the company that offers the knowledge and experience of the industry is a good opportunity for aspiring Software Engineers.

Some companies tend to take advantage for their gains. Making coffee, do data entry jobs or anything unrelated to the student's program are somewhat the usual expectation of most interns. Without proper training and somewhat a laid back environment during their internship, it would be a tragic internship one could have. Fullspeed Technologies Inc. offered something more than just the real world application of our student program. It also gave us a glimpse of the industry we want to be in. As an aspiring Software Engineer, I could honestly say that I'm fortunate to have my internship in Fullspeed. This blog is about the experience as an intern of Fullspeed Technologies Inc.

## **Interview** 
My journey as an intern started way before we were hired. Starting out by sending application letter and resume to companies, for hopes of getting hired. As the on-the-job training job hunting was on the way, I could say that most of the interviewer were from the HR department with their usual "Tell me about yourself" kind of questions. 
​
Fullspeed Technologies did the interview differently, the interviewer were the mentors of the program. Starting off with the usual interview questions, it escalated quickly to a programming exam. The mentors were seasoned Software Engineers which gave an intimidating vibe to the whole interview experience. During the exam they would give advice on how to complete the exam, which for me marked the beginning of the mentorship program.

## **Environment**
I was amazed of the office when I visited it for the interview. It was very spacious and different from most offices I went to for interviews. The office gave a Japanese aesthetic vibe of space, everything was so organized it hints a "I want to work here" feeling. When we got selected, thank you Fullspeed, we were given our very own laptops for the whole internship program. Overall it is a good environment to learn, work and socialize. All of the employees were very social and approachable making it easy for us to adopt to the office. 
## Program
### **How it works**
The internship program was to teach and apply the basic skillsets needed to be a Software Engineer. For each mentor they are assigned to specific topic or subject. 
​<br>
<br>
For each subject, the mentors would discuss the basics and immerse the interns by giving them activities. After each subject cycle the interns would give a presentation to the panel of mentors and department managers. 
​<br>
<br>
Every individual intern would present to the panel the subject and everything they learn. On top of that the panel will give a series of questions to validate the intern's learning and perception of the subject.

### **Project**
The end goal of the internship was to create a software application for the HR Department. HRMS is a software application to handle Fullspeed employee's applications to the HR. The software is not just an application, it is a collaborative effort by the interns in applying the subjects we learned throughout the internship.

## **Roadmap**
The main subjects that the mentors taught us were the technologies used during the development. Technically, we were equipped with the best practice principles and use cases of each technology. 
### 1. **Subjects**
#### 1.1. GIT
Early in the program, we were taught to use Version Control System (GIT). Globally, VCS is practiced by most if not all Software Developers. We were required to do peer reviews using GIT.
<br>
#### 1.2. RDBMS
An understanding of Relational Database Management System improves the interns in Database Management and manipulating data. Though we learned RDBMS in school, it was a good refresher for us. We 
were required to discuss 'Scalar Functions' on our presentation which is a new concept for most of us.
<br>
#### 1.3. PHP
The main programming language used in the project. The mentor taught us the main principles and advanced topics of PHP. We were tasked to create a simple TO-DO application that uses
the basic and advance concepts of PHP that we learned. 
<br>
#### 1.4. OOP
The OO concepts was not something new to us, since it's a topic covered in school. The challenge in the subject is applying the best practices and design principles in both implementation of 
modular exams and final program presentation. It was a new concept for us and was a great challenge in understanding the other side of Object Oriented Programming. 
​<br>
### 2. **Miscellaneous**
#### 2.1. The Art of Readable Code
A book about coding patterns, and the standard usage of syntax to make it more readable and concise. We were taught the global accepted code syntax which makes our code not just readable but 
also easier for our mentors to review. 
<br>
#### 2.2. Design Patterns
A solution for commonly occurring problem in software design. Applying the design patterns in our project was a great challenge for us, since we are used to a more traditional programming 
principle or rather a controlled usage of the OO concept. This was a great challenge for us since it breaks the old and bad habits of software development. The subject helped us understand the proper 
design and usage of objects. 
<br>
#### 2.3. Laravel
The framework used for the project. We were required by our mentors to know the basic usage and some advance concepts along the way. For me it was an edge for us because it helps us understand on 
how frameworks are used.
<br>
#### 2.3. Agile Methodology
A development practice creating efficient applications rapidly. The theoretical concepts of Agile was taught to us in school, applying it made us understand the importance of using methodologies in 
software development. It also helped us to be more organized and move as a single unit. 
<br>
#### 2.4. Monthly Tech Sharing
The interns were also part of the company's Monthly Engineering Sharing. Each month a Software Engineer from Fullspeed will discuss to their fellow engineers technologies in the industry. We also participated in this ceremony by sharing to them the project we made.

---
Though the presentation process was very intimidating, it helped us to be better in giving presentations. I honestly would say that the presentation process helped us cement our understanding of each subject as the mentors would give precious advises of the subject on hand. 

Overall, the internship at Fullspeed Technologies was a great experience. It helped us to be better equipped of what's to come in our career. Learning was not the only thing we gained at Fullspeed, we also made new friends along the way which makes the whole experience memorable. Kudos to our mentors for being very patient despite their time constraints, also to the Fullspeed family for being nice to us. I would 100% recommend all aspiring interns to Fullspeed Technologies Inc.
